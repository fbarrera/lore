# Stage 1: Foundation & Setup

## Overview
Establish the core infrastructure and cloud services required for the AI Storytelling App.

## Objectives
- Set up cloud services and development environment
- Configure authentication and basic data storage
- Establish AI model integration

## Deliverables
- Firebase project initialized with Auth and Firestore
- Google AI Studio linked and API keys configured
- Firestore Vector Search indexes configured
- Basic Flutter project structure with AI Toolkit integration

## Tech Stack Setup
- **Frontend:** Flutter project with AI Toolkit dependency
- **Backend:** Firebase Spark Plan (Auth, Firestore)
- **AI:** Gemini 3 Flash/Pro API access
- **Vector Search:** Firestore Vector Search configuration

## Implementation Steps
1. Initialize Firebase project and enable required services
2. Set up Google Cloud project and link to AI Studio
3. Configure Firestore Vector Search indexes
4. Create basic Flutter app structure with navigation
5. Implement Firebase authentication flow
6. Set up basic Firestore collections (users, stories, characters)

## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundation stage)

## Estimated Effort
- Flutter installation and setup: 2-3 hours
- Dependencies configuration: 1-2 hours
- Firebase setup: 2-3 hours
- AI API configuration: 1-2 hours
- Firestore Vector Search setup: 1-2 hours
- Flutter project structure: 2-3 hours
- Basic authentication: 2-3 hours
- Firestore collections: 1-2 hours

## Success Criteria
- All cloud services are active and accessible
- Basic Flutter app runs without errors
- Authentication flow works for user registration/login
- Firestore can read/write basic documents
