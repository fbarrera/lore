# Stage 1: Foundation & Setup

## Overview
Establish the core infrastructure and cloud services required for the AI Storytelling App.

## Objectives
- Set up cloud services and development environment
- Configure authentication and basic data storage
- Establish AI model integration

## Deliverables
- Firebase project initialized with Auth, Firestore, and Cloud Functions
- Google AI Studio linked and API keys configured
- Pinecone vector database set up with free tier
- Basic Flutter project structure with AI Toolkit integration

## Tech Stack Setup
- **Frontend:** Flutter project with AI Toolkit dependency
- **Backend:** Firebase Spark Plan (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- **AI:** Gemini 3 Flash/Pro API access
- **Vector DB:** Pinecone Free Tier configuration

## Implementation Steps
1. Initialize Firebase project and enable required services
2. Set up Google Cloud project and link to AI Studio
3. Configure Pinecone index and API access
4. Create basic Flutter app structure with navigation
5. Implement Firebase authentication flow
6. Set up basic Firestore collections (users, stories, characters)

## Dependencies
